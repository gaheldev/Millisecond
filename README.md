Millisecond is a gtk app based on [rctqs](https://codeberg.org/rtcqs/rtcqs). \
It provides system diagnostics and offers tips to improve low latency performance for audio production, with links to detailed documentation from [linuxaudio wiki](https://wiki.linuxaudio.org/wiki/system_configuration).

In future releases, I intend to allow running fixes from the app whenever possible.

It would be lovely to get icon contributions that follow [flathub's standards](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/guidelines/app-icons.html)  to be able to distribute the app there.
