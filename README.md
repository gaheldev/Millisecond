# Installation
<!-- ## Flatpak  -->
<!---->
<!-- If flatpak is not installed on your system yet, follow [flathub's instructions](https://flathub.org/setup) for your system. -->
<!-- Now install the [latest release](TODO). -->

<!-- ## Direct compilation/installation -->

You'll need to install dev dependencies first (TODO) then run:
```
git clone TODO
cd millisecond
meson setup build/
meson install -C build/
```

# Contributions
It would be lovely to get icon contributions that follow [flathub's standards](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/guidelines/app-icons.html)  to be able to distribute the app.
